**TL;DR**: VesselFM is a foundation model for universal 3D blood vessel segmentation. It is trained on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, synthetic data generated through domain randomization, and data sampled from a flow matching-based deep generative model. These data sources provide enough diversity to enable vesselFM to achieve exceptional *zero*-shot blood vessel segmentation, even in completely unseen domains. For details, please refer to our [manuscript](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Wittmann_vesselFM_A_Foundation_Model_for_Universal_3D_Blood_Vessel_Segmentation_CVPR_2025_paper.html).

## 🟢 Updates

- 08/2026: We release checkpoints trained on a **broader training set including our evaluation set**, for potentially increased *zero-shot* performance.


## 🟢 Installation
First, set up a conda environment and install dependencies:

    conda create -n vesselfm python=3.9

    conda activate vesselfm

    pip install -e .


## 🟢 *Zero*-Shot Segmentation
If you are solely interested in running vesselFM's inference script for *zero*-shot segmentation of data at hand, adjust the respecitve [config file](vesselfm/seg/configs/inference.yaml) (see `#TODO`) and run:

    python vesselfm/seg/inference.py

Additional information on inference, pre-training, and fine-tuning are available [here](./vesselfm/seg). Checkpoints will be downloaded automatically and are also available on [Hugging Face 🤗](https://huggingface.co/bwittmann/vesselFM).


## 🟢 Data Sources
<img src="docs/data_sources.png">

We also provide individual instructions for generating our three proposed data sources.

$\mathcal{D}_\text{drand}$: Domain randomized synthetic data ([here](./vesselfm/d_drand)).

$\mathcal{D}_\text{flow}$: Synthetic data sampled from our flow matching-based deep generative model ([here](./vesselfm/d_flow)).

$\mathcal{D}_\text{real}$: Real data curated from 17 annotated blood vessel segmentation datasets ([here](./vesselfm/d_real)).
