$\mathcal{D}_\text{real}$ is comprised of 17 individual datasets. Below, we detail how these datasets can be accessed. You may have to explicitly request access for some of them.

Note that we do **not** provide licenses for these datasets. Therefore, one must adhere to their specified licensing terms.

## Initial Pre-Processing
To pre-process all above datasets and standardize their format, run:

    python vesselfm/d_real/dataset_conversion.py </path/to/raw_dataset> </path/to/preprocessed_dataset>

Note that the name of the raw dataset folder should correspond to a dataset specified in `dataset_conversion.py` (e.g., `3dircadb1`).
Additional information - if required - is provided in the comments of the respective scripts.

## Patch Extraction & Offline Data Augmentation
To speed up training, we apply data augmentation on patches extracted from the pre-processed datasets offline. 

    python extract_patches.py

Please edit `config/dataset_creation.yaml` to include the datasets of interest and adjust the paths (see `#TODO`).
One can utilize our algorithm for label improvement on HR-Kidney operating on patches for compute efficiency by running `dataset_conversion/improve_HR_kidney.py` to obtain `HRKidney_thresh` used in our experiments.

The final structure of $\mathcal{D}_\text{real}$ must be organized as follows:
```
/path/to/d_real   # D_real
└── 3Dircadb1/  # individual datasets
  └── 0/   # sample 0
    └── img.npy   # pre-processed, extracted, augmented patch of shape 128x128x128
    └── mask.npy  # matching label of shape 128x128x128
  ...
